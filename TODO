 - Number of files in movie dir hasn't changed at all: bug with adding new movies?
 - in ratings.py, raise error if XPATHTOOLS not defined in env
 - store movies, critics and ratings in a database (sqlite?)
 - do i need to worry about regularization?
 - why is minimize() failing to converge?
 - Supply Jacobians/Hessians to objective function and ineq constraints
 - expose following configuration as options:
    * both penalty terms
    * critic significance threshold
 - make should complain if wget is not found
 - make should not litter the working directory with unnecessary files

DONE

 X option: combine all reviewers from a publication into one.
 X plot y(theta) to understand if it is convex?
 X how to measure the performance of the optimization model?
 X suppress html parser errors from xpathtool runs
 X switch to argparser
 X migrate to using setup.py
 X decouple the extraction of training set from the optimization routine
    * this will allow consistent comparisons
 X scale the produced theta values to be between 0 and 1.
 X introduce two new Make targets: make slsqp, make cobyla
